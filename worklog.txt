May 2020
- Concept for project: Stock visualization application. Should be able to show essential features of a trading tool such as historical prices, highs/lows, volume, etc.
- Searched for API's or libraries to pull stock information from.
- Decided on IEX API. There are some limitations to the API regarding what information can be requested with a free account. We will see how it turns out.
- Spent a week familiarizing myself with the API and what information can be gleaned.

June 2020
- Began programming the GET portion of the project and looking into how visualization would be done. Originally intended to use an R script to create visualizations but stumbled on the python Bokeh library which offers similar tools with aesthetic visuals in python. 
- Experimented with Bokeh and have grown to like it a lot. 
- Combined GET with visualization, accidentally used up all my API calls for the month by forgetting to comment out a call that wasn't being used... Gonna work on some other stuff in the meantime. 

July 2020
- Looking into an interface to use for the application. Experimented with tkinter but it's not very aesthetic. Looking into Flask now.
- Got into Flask and html coding using online tutorials to help me along. Still not the most aesthetic but I've been able to incorporate a lot of neat things. I decided to use the subreddit r/wallstreetbets as a theme for the web app and it definitely shows.
- Got individual pieces of the web app running (web app itself and charting functions)
- Struggled with embedding my Bokeh plot into html but got it in the end.
- Working version of the web app is built. Room for improvement is discussed in webapp.py.
- Was working on a fix for the axes not being shown in the bokeh plot when I ran out of API calls. 
- Fixed axes, implemented flash messages for API errors.

Aug 2020
- Finally got around to setting up Github in PyCharm.
- Updated preview.
- Trying to use heroku to deploy a live version of the webapp on github. Having some difficulty with gunicorn.
